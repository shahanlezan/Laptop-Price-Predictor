# Laptop Price Predictor

## Introduction

In the age of rapid technological change, understanding the value of what we use is more essential than ever. The **Laptop Price Predictor** isn’t just a machine learning model — it's a tool designed to bring clarity to consumers, students, and tech enthusiasts. It gives you the power to estimate laptop prices using data-driven insights and intelligent modeling.

## Vision

This project exists to simplify how we understand pricing in the tech market. By analyzing hardware specifications and leveraging regression algorithms, this model reveals how various features—like processor type, RAM, storage, and brand—translate into cost.

It is not about guessing; it’s about revealing the logic behind the numbers.

## Key Features

- **Clean Data Pipeline**: Data is preprocessed with care, filtering out inconsistencies and preparing it for meaningful analysis.
- **Intelligent Modeling**: Built using regression techniques to predict prices with a focus on accuracy and interpretability.
- **Simple Interface**: Designed to be minimal yet powerful. Enter specifications and receive a real-time price prediction.
- **Scalable Design**: The codebase is modular and ready for enhancements, whether for a web app or integration with a larger system.
